[00:11.08] I can't stand to think about
[00:15.02] A heart so big it hurts like hell
[00:19.12] Oh my God, I gave my best
[00:22.18] But for three whole years to end like this
[00:43.18] 
[00:26.18] Well do you want to fall apart
[00:30.10] I can't stop if you can't start
[00:34.10] Do you want to fall apart
[00:37.16] I could if you can try to fix what I've undone
[00:43.13] Cause I hate what I've become
[00:57.63] 
[00:45.26] You know me,
[00:48.22] Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
[00:53.25] I've been waiting all this time to be
[00:56.25] Something I can't define. So let's
[01:01.28] Cause a scene
[01:04.27] Clap our hands and stomp our feet or something,
[01:09.26] Yeah something.
[01:11.27] I've just got to get myself over me
[01:28.77] 
[01:23.36] I could stand to do without
[01:26.32] All the people I have left behind
[01:30.31] What's the point in going 'round
[01:34.35] When it's a straight line baby, a straight line down
[02:00.35] 
[01:37.34] So let's make a list of who we need
[01:41.38] And it's not much, if anything
[01:45.45] Let's make a list of who we need
[01:48.49] And we'll throw it away cause we don't need anyone
[01:54.42] No, we don't need anyone
[02:06.42] 
[01:57.48] You know me,
[02:00.43] Or you think you do, you just don't seem to see

[02:42.16] 
[02:37.66] You know the night life is just not for me
[02:41.65] 'Cause all you really need are a few good friends
[02:45.66] I don't want to go out and be on my own
[02:48.62] You know they started something I can't stand
[03:11.12] 
[02:52.79] You leave for the city, well count me out
[03:00.73] 'Cause all this time is wasted on
[03:04.75] Well, everything I've done
[03:17.75] 
[03:06.74] You know me,
[03:11.78] Or you think you do you, you just don't seem to see
